### Example 1

#### Input:
**SalesPerson table:**

| sales_id | name | salary | commission_rate | hire_date  |
|----------|------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| 1        | John | 100000 | 6               | 4/1/2006   |
| 2        | Amy  | 12000  | 5               | 5/1/2010   |
| 3        | Mark | 65000  | 12              | 12/25/2008 |
| 4        | Pam  | 25000  | 25              | 1/1/2005   |
| 5        | Alex | 5000   | 10              | 2/3/2007   |

**Company table:**

| com_id | name   | city     |
|--------|--------|----------|
| 1      | RED    | Boston   |
| 2      | ORANGE | New York |
| 3      | YELLOW | Boston   |
| 4      | GREEN  | Austin   |

**Orders table:**

| order_id | order_date | com_id | sales_id | amount |
|----------|------------|--------|----------|--------|
| 1        | 1/1/2014   | 3      | 4        | 10000  |
| 2        | 2/1/2014   | 4      | 5        | 5000   |
| 3        | 3/1/2014   | 1      | 1        | 50000  |
| 4        | 4/1/2014   | 1      | 4        | 25000  |

#### Output:
| name |
|------|
| Amy  |
| Mark |
| Alex |

---

### Explanation:
- **Orders 3 and 4** are linked to the company `"RED"` (`com_id = 1`), handled by salespersons `John` and `Pam`.
- The remaining salespersons (`Amy`, `Mark`, `Alex`) have no orders associated with `"RED"`, so they are included in the output.
